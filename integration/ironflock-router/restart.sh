# (relative: go test runs the test in integration/, so the command needs no
# quoting whatever the checkout path; give it STATE_DIR when that is not the
# default, e.g. by exporting it).
#
# Stops the router, keeps it down for RESTART_DOWNTIME seconds (default 3),
# starts it again with the same config, and returns once it is healthy and the
# fake platform has rejoined all its realms. It acts on the instance recorded
# in STATE_DIR (default .run next to this script) and needs no other
# environment.
