// of continuous no_such_realm refusals the cap widens to

// a reconnect. When the context ends first, a Subscribe or Register returns
// its error having sent nothing; an Unsubscribe, UnsubscribeTopic or
// Unregister returns it too, but has taken effect locally already and tells
// the router in the background (see Unsubscribe). A Call returns its
// context's error as soon as the context ends, and the router is told to
// cancel the call in the background (see Call). The router round trip of
// Publish, Subscribe, Register, Unsubscribe and Unregister is not
// interruptible once sent; it is bounded by the router response timeout
